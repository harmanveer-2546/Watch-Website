  <h2>"You simply don’t become official supplier to world aviation by chance"</h2>
<p>
  Known as an "innovator by tradition," Tissot has accomplished a long line of firsts in watchmaking history, including creating the first-ever men’s wristwatch. The brand’s
  sporty timepieces are championed by collectors with an affinity for precision as well as by first-time buyers, thanks to their accessible price point.
  <br><br>
  For more than 160 years, Tissot has produced timepieces of exceptional quality. As the Official Timekeeper of the NBA and Tour de France, Tissot watches maintain a high standard for accuracy and reliability. This commitment to being "innovative by design" can be seen in pieces like the iconic Powermatic movements, which boast 80 hours of battery reserve, and the Seastar dive collection, which is water-resistant up to 1,000 feet. With its dedication to quality, every Tissot watch 
  features Swiss movements produced in-house to the highest specifications, bringing a standard of excellence to its devoted clientele.
